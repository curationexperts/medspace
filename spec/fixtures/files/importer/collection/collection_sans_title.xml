   <description>The Medical Center Library’s Historical Images in Medicine (HIM) collections encompass over 3,000 photographs, illustrations, engravings, and bookplates from the history of the health and life sciences. Special collections in HIM include Bartisch’s Ophthalmodouleia, the Bookplates, the Four Season and the Stewart Album. In the past the HIM images were only retrievable by our History of Medicine Collections staff, but they are now available via the Internet. The Web versions of the images are not publication quality, nor are they intended for such use. If you see images you would like to incorporate into your publications, please contact the History of Medicine Collections Curator, for information. Grants from The Mary Duke Biddle Foundation and The Josiah Charles Trent Memorial Foundation made possible the realization of the Historical Images in Medicine database.</description>
   <description>In addition to individual images, The Historical Images in Medicine Collection contains four smaller collections of materials.  1) Georg Bartisch’s <em>Ophthalmodouleia Das ist Augendienst</em>; 2) The Bookplate Collection; 3) The Four Seasons; and 4) The Stewart Album.</description>
